DevelopmentVM
=============

A virtual machine for general development.


#Installation
Make sure you have the vagrant librarian chef plugin before running ```vagrant up```.

```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-librarian-chef-nochef
```

I use the nochef plugin because it can be used on linux and Windows.
